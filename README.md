# Ultra Marathon Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes ultra marathon data from events held in the United States during 2022, focusing on 50km and 50-mile races. The analysis explores:  
- Performance trends  
- Finishing times  
- Relationships between age, gender, and speed  

## Dataset
The data comes from [The Big Dataset of Ultra Marathon Running](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running) on Kaggle.  
This analysis focuses on a cleaned subset containing US races from 2022.  

## Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of over 7 million raw records  
- Focused analysis on US-based 50km and 50-mile events  
- Detailed visualization of performance distributions and relationships  
- Statistical analysis of performance metrics by age and gender  
- Race distance comparisons and trend identification  

## Tools
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Key Findings
- The average finishing time across analyzed races was approximately 8.4 hours  
- The average athlete age was 41.5 years, showing ultrarunning attracts a more mature demographic  
- Male participants outnumber female participants across all race distances  
- Performance tends to peak in the 30-40 age range for both genders  
- The distribution of finishing speeds centers between 7-9 km/h for most participants  
- Average speeds decrease as race distances increase, as expected  
- Both 50km and 50-mile races show similar gender-based performance patterns  
- Performance data follows expected statistical distributions, with clear patterns between age and speed  

## Visualizations Included
- Race distance distribution  
- Participation by gender across different distances  
- Age distribution of participants  
- Average speeds and finishing times  
- Performance correlations between age, gender, and race distance
